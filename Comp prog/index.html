                <p> Dear Parents,</p>
            </h2>
            <h4> &ensp; &ensp; This is the first Christmas and New Year that we have celebrated miles apart. It feels weird and eerie.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    &ensp; &ensp; I may not be the most vocal, sweet and angelic child but please know that I really do appreciate everything you've done for us three. The sacrifices and the effort you two made will never be in vain.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>

                    &ensp; &ensp; For the first time in 12 years, I would have never imagined that we would be celebrating holidays differently.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    &ensp; &ensp; I really wished I could go back there but right now I promise to focus on my studies and of course guide and help my little sister here with me.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> &ensp; &ensp; Please know that I love the both of you very much even if I may not be that expressive. Thank you for everything and I hope we do see each other soon although I might have to wait for a few years.
                </p>
